NetBSD specific notes
=====================

On NetBSD, slag has only been tested with libao, not with JACK.

I had to set a few environment variables to compile and run Slag on NetBSD 3.0.
With a bourne style shell, the commands are :

	export QTDIR=/usr/pkg/qt3
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib

The last one should be fixed by passing -Wl,-R/usr/X11R6/lib to the linker 
in order to embed this path into the binary. However I haven't found yet 
a clean way to do this in the build process.
